To build and run. Make sure you have CUDA and OPEN_CV and CMAKE installed. You can probably get away with not having CMAKE.

cd build (if have cmake, cmake ..)
make clean
make
../bin/BGS

if it doesn't work may need to export paths or add opencv and nvcc to your search paths

export OpenCV_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/2.4.6.1/
